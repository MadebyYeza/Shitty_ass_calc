# Shitty_ass_calc
A calculator that does math... and sometimes roasts you for asking it to. Built in Python for fun and learning.

A minimal console calculator built in Python — simple, functional, and a little too honest for its own good.  
It adds numbers, cracks jokes, and occasionally questions your intelligence (all in good humor, of course).

This project started as a fun way to learn Python while keeping things entertaining.  

If it makes you laugh, mission accomplished ✅

## ⚙️ How to Run It

You have **two ways** to use the calculator:

### 🐍 Option 1 — Run the Python Script  
If you already have Python installed, just open a terminal (or command prompt) and run:

```bash
python shitty_calc.py
```


### 💾 Option 2 — Use the Executable (.exe)

If you don’t have Python installed, don’t worry!
You can run the calculator directly by double-clicking the shitty_ass_calc.exe file.
It’s exactly the same as the .py version — just pre-packed for convenience.

### 🧠 Why It Exists

Because learning Python shouldn’t be boring —
and calculators shouldn’t be this rude lol.
