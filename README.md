# Shitty_ass_calc
A calculator that does math... and sometimes roasts you for asking it to. Built in Python for fun and learning.

A minimal console calculator built in Python — simple, functional, and a little too honest for its own good.  
It adds numbers, cracks jokes, and occasionally questions your intelligence (all in good humor, of course).

This project started as a fun way to learn Python while keeping things entertaining.  

If it makes you laugh, mission accomplished ✅

## ✨ Features
- Does basic addition (and attitude).
- Random jokes and sarcastic comments.
- Works entirely in the console.
- Lightweight and portable — just Python and bad manners required.

## 📦 HOW TO USE
────────────────────────────────────────────

All you need is inside the **Shitty_Ass_Calc.zip** file.

1️⃣ Download the ZIP from this repository.  
2️⃣ Extract it anywhere on your computer.  
3️⃣ You’ll find two files inside:
   - `shitty_calc.py` → the original Python source code  
   - `shitty_ass_calc.exe` → the ready-to-run executable  

### 🐍 Option 1 — Run the Python Script  
If you already have Python installed, just open a terminal (or command prompt) and run:

```bash
python shitty_calc.py
```


### 💾 Option 2 — Use the Executable (.exe)

If you don’t have Python installed, don’t worry!
You can run the calculator directly by double-clicking the shitty_ass_calc.exe file.
It’s exactly the same as the .py version — just pre-packed for convenience.

### 🧠 Why It Exists

Because learning Python shouldn’t be boring —
and calculators shouldn’t be this rude lol.
